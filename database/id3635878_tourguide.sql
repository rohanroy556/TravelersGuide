The caves include paintings and rock cut sculptures described as among the finest surviving examples of ancient Indian art, particularly expressive paintings that present emotion through gesture, pose and form.\r\nAccording to UNESCO, these are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art that influenced Indian art that followed. The caves were built in two phases, the first group starting around the 2nd century BC, while the second group of caves built around 400–650 CE according to older accounts, or all in a brief period of 460 to 480 according to Walter M.

The caves also present paintings depicting the past lives and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura\'s Jatakamala, as well as rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities in vogue between the 2nd century BCE and 5th century CE. Textual records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India. While vivid colours and mural wall painting were abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records, Caves 16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-painting.\r\nThe Ajanta Caves site are mentioned in the memoirs of several medieval era Chinese Buddhist travellers to India and by a Mughal era official of Akbar era in early 17th century. They were covered by jungle until accidentally \"discovered\" and brought to the Western attention in 1819 by a colonial British officer on a tiger hunting party. The Ajanta caves are located on the side of a rocky cliff that is on the north side of a U-shaped gorge on the small river Waghur, in the Deccan plateau. Further round the gorge are a number of waterfalls, which when the river is high are audible from outside the caves.\r\nWith the Ellora Caves, Ajanta is the major tourist attraction of Maharashtra.

However, it is widely accepted that charminar was built at the center of the city, to commemorate the eradication of Cholera\", a deadly disease which was wide spread at that time as Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah had prayed for the end of a plague that was ravaging his city and vowed to build a Mosque at the very place where he prayed. According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveller of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts, the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic millennium year (1000 AH). The event was celebrated far and wide in the Islamic world, thus Qutb Shah founded the city of Hyderabad to celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this building. Due to its architecture it is also called as arc de triomphe of the east.\r\nHistorian Masud Hussain Khan says that the construction of Charminar was completed in the year 1592, and that it is the city of Hyderabad which was actually founded in the year 1591. According to the book \"Days of the Beloved\", Qutb shah constructed the Charminar in the year 1589, on the very spot where he first glimpsed his future queen Bhagmati, and after her conversion to Islam, Qutb Shah renamed the city as \"Hyderabad\". Though the story was denied by the historians and scholars, it became popular folklore among the locals.'),

It is divided into 14 districts with the capital and the largest city being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.\r\nThe region has been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala, though it frequently struggled against attacks by the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for the European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence, there were two major princely states in Kerala - Travancore and Kochi. They united to form Thirukochi. The Malabar region, in the north part of present-day Kerala was under the Madras province of British India.

The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. The culture is a synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.\r\nThe production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. The state\'s coastline extends for 595 kilometres (370 mi), and around 1.1 million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state\'s income. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam.

In 1962, China and India fought a brief war over Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh, but in 1993 and 1996 the two countries signed agreements to respect the Line of Actual Control.\r\nIn the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes, but since the Chinese authorities closed the borders with Tibet and Central Asia in the 1960s, international trade has dwindled except for tourism. Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. Since Ladakh is a part of strategically important Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian military maintains a strong presence in the region.\r\nThe largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil. Almost half of Ladakhis are Shia Muslims and the rest are mostly Tibetan Buddhists.

Another tourist, Rizwan from Sri Lanka said he has decided to go back to his country after futile attempts to exchange money from banks.\r\nTourists are not the only ones who seem to be bearing the brunt of demonetisation. Local hotel owners and money exchangers are also strained by the sudden footfall of tourists.\r\nCurrency exchangers are worried due to the lack of cash. \"Every tourist is facing challenges in exchanging money. We don\'t have change or anything to pay small bills ourselves; our business has come to a standstill,\" said Rajiv, a local money exchanger.\r\nIn the past 10 days, tourism reservations have fallen by 30-40 per cent, sources in the Central Tourism Reservation office (CRO) in Delhi said. Two days after the government announced the currency ban, tourist numbers dropped so low that the CRO itself has to cancel all bookings to nearby destinations.\r\nHowever, Foreign Tourist Arrivals in October this year saw a 10 per cent hike compared to last year, the government has said.', '2017-11-20'),
